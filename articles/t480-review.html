      <p>I've been using the Thinkpad T480 for about 4 months now, and I gotta say, as my first Thinkpad, It's one of the best laptops that I ever used. And I though I'd talk about my experience with it, as well as how it preforms and some of my gripes about It.</p>
      <p>My laptop is configured with 8 Gigabytes of ram, an i7-8650U, and Intel UHD graphics. I'm running Fedora with KDE as an operating system.</p>
