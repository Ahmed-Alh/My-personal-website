        <p1>In the age of privacy invasions and data breaches, it's now more important than ever to store all of your data locally instead of having your data in some company's data farm. A great way to do this is to make your own server at home to store all of your data in it, so that you can access it sort of like a network attached storage (NAS). This guide is going to try to explain how you can start selfhosting.
        </p1>
        <h2>Why should you Selfhost?</h2>
        <p2>There are alot of reasons as to why you should selfhost, like: <br>
        <ul>
        <li>Total control over your data and what you can store on your server.</li>
        <li>More private than using a service by a company like Google. (I.e no one can snoop in on your data and analyze it)</li>
        <li>inherently more secure than using an online namebrand service. As big services are targets for hackers, while your small home server wouldn't be.</li>
        <li>You don't need internet to access your data, since you'll have it all stored in your home.</li>
        <li>Cheaper than using a paid service or a Virtual private server (VPS), as you don't have to pay monthy fees (except for your electricity bill) or subscribe to a service to access your data. And while you're gonna pay more initially for a computer than using a VPS, it will be a bigger bang for your buck than if you bought a Vps with the same configurations. </li>
        </ul>
        Moreover, you can selfhost your data on most, if not any computer. Even  <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/" style="color: cadetblue;">a $35 Raspberry pi </a> or an old used Lenovo Thinkpad off of Ebay will suffice.
    </p2>
    <h2>How you can selfhost</h2>
    <p1>"How can I start selfhosting?" you might as. Well, you'll first need the following:</p1>
    <ol>
    <li>A Computer, preferrably one with a gigabit ethernet port</li>
    <li>An Internet connection, Obviously</li>
    <li>An ethernet jack. (While a wireless home server is possible, it is highly preffered to use a wired internet connection as your home server will be used to move data back and forth, and that might saturate your wifi bandwifth, leaving it very slow.) </li>
    <li>An operating system other than Windows (more on that later)</li>
    <li>Storage, such as a hard dive (an external one can be used, but they tend to be less reliable than standalone hard drives)</li>
    <li>Basic knowledge of networking and computers will be helpful.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step 1: pick an operating system.</h3>
    <p2>without an operating system (OS) you just have a metal box of capacitors and PCBs. Picking an operating system is the first step in making a home server, and it won't be easy for people unfamiliar with servers. <br> You shouldn't be using the desktop version of  Windows, since it is only intended for desktop use. That's why we have to use Gnu/Linux (what is generally known as linux). There are many flavors of linux (distributions), and you'll have to choose one of them. Personally, I'd pick one of the following:</p2>
    <ul>
        <li>OpenMediaVault (OMV), for the person who prefers a more basic and simple interface.</li>
        <li>Debian</li>  
        <li>Fedora Server</li>  
        <li>CentOS</li>  
        <li>Ubuntu Server</li>         
    </ul>
    <p2>All Gnu/Linux distributions can work well for server use (with tweaking and optimizing of course) but there are specific things you need to look out for in a distribution, like how frequent are the packages upgraded, how stable is the distribution itself, etc.
