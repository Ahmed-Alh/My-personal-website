      <h1> All-in-one Raspberry pi NAS and torrenting server! <sub style="font-size:50%;"> <sub>Published on: x/xx/2020, edited on x/xx/2020</sub></h1>
        <p1>So I've needed a NAS solution for some time now, mainly for the convenience of having a decent-sized External hard drive that I can access anywhere from my LAN. But then I also wanted a torrenting solution so i can <strike>pirate movies and games</strike> <bold> seed linux ISOs, obviously.</bold> So that's what I've been trying to build during the last couple of days, and I feel like I've finished setting it up, even though I still need to learn how to efficiently back up the server's OS (currently just using dd to back it up to an IMG file), and somehow unjank it (but that's the nature of raspberry pi projects amirite?).
